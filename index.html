            body piercing and tattooing in the area. Let our professional staff help you express 
            your personality and individuality with our custom tattoos and body piercings.  help people make their 
            outsides match their insides, to be a part of an industry that is always changing and getting better.
             I get to be inspired by artists all over the world. Tattoos are available for individuals who are
             18 years and older. If you’ve made the decision to get a tattoo or body modification, your 
             next step is to come to our location to speak with our artists. Or you may call us at 
             508-754-0564 for any questions on piercings, tattoos, and permanent makeup solutions.ased in Vancouver,
              Canada, Crystal Osaurus is a self-taught tattoo artist who prides herself on hard work, determination, 
              and helping her clients find peace within and without themselves. From what we gathered in our interview with her, 
              she revels in the art, the evolution of the art, and the gaining respect of the art. Most days you can find her 
              hard at work at I-Kandy Tattoo & Piercing. 
              I’ve always been interested in modifying my body and having my art as the main source of my income. 
              I had just never thought tattooing would be something I would be able to do; I’ve always been super sensitive,
               and in this business, you need to have a tough skin. But in the end, the industry chose me, and it seems that as 
               long as I keep trying to be better, it will continue to let me be a part of it.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">The best days are the days I fix a tattoo someone was unhappy with. Or cover scars that made them 
            embarrassed. Or do a memorial tattoo that brings them to tears and helps begin their healing process. Pain has power, 
            especially when you choose it.
            They have been so supportive, whether or not they agree with tattoos. My friends let me learn on them, let me try out new techniques,
             helped me see things with different sets of eyes. My father lent me the money to get my equipment, even though he thinks tattoos are
              the worst thing you can do to your body (laughs). They helped me not be overly hard on myself, and they gave me constructive criticism 
              when I needed a reality check.
