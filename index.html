   <h2>Our family's last taste of normal before Covid-19 errupted</h2>

   <p>It’s an understatement to call these times "crazy". 
      The world has changed in the last two months, and not for the better. 
      The panic is real, spreading across the world as the coronavirus continues to appear relentlessly in city after city.
      Unfortunately, this also signified that travel is not a good idea.
      Instead of touching up last-minute plans for an epic summer of 2020 with the Olympics and a homecoming to the Philippines,
       we're on hold just like the rest of the world - simply hunkering down in our home and waiting this out.
   </p>
      The only thing to do is look ahead to when life returns to normal. Once precautions are lifted,
      we’ll be free to head back outside, abroad, over oceans and borders to enjoy the staggering beauty
      and limitless freedom that only travel can deliver. While we're not able to travel now, we can certainly start dreaming and planning.
      Having said that, I have rounded up a handful of my favorite adventure travel pieces to keep my wanderlust sparked during dark times.
      Let's not lose our itch to explore the world, just put a pin in it temporarily while we all get through this together.
