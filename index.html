         <p class="indent"><span class="first-letter">I</span>t’s an understatement to call these times "crazy".
            The world has changed in the last two months, and not for the better.
            The panic is existent, spreading across the world as the coronavirus continues to manifest itself
            relentlessly in city after city.
            Unfortunately, this situation implied that travel is not a very clever idea.
            Instead of patching up last-minute plans for an epic summer of 2020 with the Olympics and a homecoming to
            the Philippines, we're on hold just like the rest of the world - simply hunkering down in our home and
            waiting this out.
         </p>
         <p class="indent">The only thing to do is to follow the government's orders to suppress the spread of the
            virus, keep our mind, body and soul healty,
            be hopeful and look ahead to when life returns to normal.
            Once all this is over and precautions are lifted,
            we’ll be free to head back outside, abroad, over oceans and borders to enjoy the staggering beauty
            and limitless freedom that only travel can deliver. While we're not able to travel now, we can certainly
            start dreaming and planning.
            Having said that, I have rounded up a handful of my favorite adventure travel pieces to keep my wanderlust
            sparked during dark times.

            to be.

            The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it,
            <br>
            how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn.” </blockquote>

            you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you.”</blockquote>
