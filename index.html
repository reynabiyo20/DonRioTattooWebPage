         <h1>About</h1>
         <p class="indent"><span class="first-letter">I</span> provide the public with the highest quality
            tattooing with reasonable price in Baguio City and sourrounding areas. I pride myself on hard work,
            determination and helping my clients express their personality and individuality to make their
            outsides match their insides. My best days are the days I fix a tattoo someone was unhappy with. Or
            cover scars that made them embarrassed. Or do a memorial tattoo that brings them to tears and helps begin
            their healing process.
            My favorite tattoos to do are koi and polynesian.

            I love caps and shoes and I own a collection of various vintage and new ones. My friends say I'm hilarious
            but I'm not so sure.
            My family has been very supportive, whether or not they agree with tattoos. My closest friends let me learn
            on them,
            let me try out new techniques, helped me see things with different sets of eyes. My siblings and my father
            lent
            me the bodies to be my canvass even though my mother thinks tattoos are the worst thing you can do to your
            body. They
            supported me and gave me constructive criticism when I needed a reality check.
         </p>

         <p class="indent">
            I’ve always been interested in tattooing and having my art as the main source of my income.
            I had just never thought tattooing would be something I would be able to do. I’ve been
            doubtful on myself and in this business, you need to have a tough skin. But in the end, the industry chose
            me, and it seems that as long as I keep trying to be better, it will continue to let me be a part of it.
